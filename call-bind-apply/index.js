// call, bind, and apply
// These methods are used to control the value of 'this' in functions and to invoke functions with specific contexts and arguments.
// They are essential for managing function execution in JavaScript.
// Understanding these methods helps in writing more flexible and reusable code.
// call: Invokes a function with a specified 'this' value and arguments provided individually.
// apply: Invokes a function with a specified 'this' value and arguments provided as an array (or array-like object).
// bind: Returns a new function that, when called, has its 'this' keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
